## Comment

The beginning of my study of DSA was laid by the algorithmic "marathon" by Yandex, which took place in february-march 2023. Soon after, I began actively training on LeetCode. At the end of July 2023, I tried my hand at competitve programming on Codeforces.

Contests bring me great pleasure, and I actively train to become better in competitive programming. You can follow my progress through the links:
