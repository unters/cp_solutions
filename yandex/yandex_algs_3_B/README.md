# Yandex, algomarathon 3.0

This folder contains solutions to tasks from third algorithmic "marathon" by Yandex which was the beginning of my journey into the world of DSA.

This event was held for educational purpuses. First 10 (out of 40) tasks were on the topics of previous marathons - they were of no interest to me.

At the beginning of the marathon, I had a very basic and incomplete knowledge of DSA and C++. Solutions in the folder have not been modified since the marathon - all of them were accepted by the verification system, but have obvious stylistic drawbacks (e.g. using `int * a = new int[n];` arrays instead of `std::vector<int> a(n);`).
